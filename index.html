        <h2> Shepherds discovered coffee in Ethiopia circa 800 A.D. </h2>
         
        Legend has it that 9th century 
        goat herders noticed the effect caffeine 
        had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" 
        after eating coffee berries. A local monk then made a 
        drink with coffee berries and found that it kept him 
        awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee was born.
